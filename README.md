# Overview

This is a quick experiment to test GPT-4s SVG & CSS creation ability. I initially wanted to just change the feel of the webpage based on the input of the user, but then found it interesting to see how well the model could create SVGs.

The end result does a bit of both. It creates SVGs of the words you enter and updates the styling of the page based on the combination of those words.

## To Run

create a .env file and add a `SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY` with your open AI key.
Then, run `npm run dev`.
